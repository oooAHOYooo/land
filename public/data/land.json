Lack of frontage can severely limit building ability (zoning, utilities, access).\n• \"Walk to water, waterfront\" but utilities \"None, Water Not Available\" — so no municipal water presumably; check septic/onsite wastewater possibilities.\n• The topography is \"rolling\" and fully wooded. Being irregularly shaped may affect how much usable buildable area exists.\n• It is in Smithfield, Rhode Island (Providence County) so you'll need to consult the Town's zoning & building regulations.\n\nIs building possible?\n\nShort answer: Possibly, but you'll need to very carefully check certain factors. Here are the main questions:\n• Zoning district: What zoning applies at that parcel (log Rd, Smithfield)? Does the zoning allow a dwelling on raw land? Are there minimum frontage, lot size, access requirements? The town's zoning ordinance will clarify.\n• Access / frontage: Since the listing says \"no road frontage\", you'll need to see how access is legally provided. If the lot has no legal frontage or easement for a driveway, the town may not issue a building permit.\n• Utilities / wastewater / water: If municipal water is unavailable, you'll need to see if a well is allowed, or if you'll rely on a septic system. Check if wetlands or other environmental constraints apply. Also check watershed restrictions since the nearby reservoir and pond may impose additional environmental controls.\n• Wetlands / water‐body setbacks: If the lot abuts the pond, there may be wetland buffers or setbacks that reduce the buildable area.\n• Town building‐zoning department: The town's website states you may need to apply for \"Variance\", \"Special Use Permit\", or ask for \"Building & Zoning\" approval.\n• Legal title / \"as is\" condition: Buyer must do due diligence to confirm there are no hidden issues (e.g., no road frontage may mean no driveway, or the lot may be landlocked).\n• Environmental constraints: Being next to water (pond) and near the Stillwater Reservoir area (see below) you may have extra environmental oversight.\n\nConclusion: It's not impossible to build — but significant red flags (lack of frontage, no utilities shown, \"as is\" condition) mean you should engage a local land‐use attorney or civil engineer to evaluate feasibility before purchase."
